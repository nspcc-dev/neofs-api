  // explicitly set:
  //
  // * Capacity \
  //   Total available disk space in Gigabytes.
  // * Price \
  //   Price in GAS tokens for storing one GB of data during one Epoch. In node
  //   attributes it's a string presenting floating point number with comma or
  //   point delimiter for decimal part. In the Network Map it will be saved as
  //   64-bit unsigned integer representing number of minimal token fractions.
  // * Subnet \
  //   String ID of Node's storage subnet. There can be only one subnet served
  //   by the Storage Node.
  // * UN-LOCODE \
  //   Node's geographic location in
  //   [UN/LOCODE](https://www.unece.org/cefact/codesfortrade/codes_index.html)
  //   format approximated to the nearest point defined in the standard.

  //   Country code in
  //   [ISO 3166-1_alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
  //   format. Calculated automatically from `UN-LOCODE` attribute.
  // * Country \
  //   Country short name in English, as defined in
  //   [ISO-3166](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search). Calculated automatically
  //   from `UN-LOCODE` attribute.
  // * Location \
  //   Place names are given, whenever possible, in their national language
  //   versions as expressed in the Roman alphabet using the 26 characters of
  //   the character set adopted for international trade data interchange,
  //   written without diacritics . Calculated automatically from `UN-LOCODE`
