// Container is a structure that defines object placement behaviour. Objects can

// access control information. An ID of a container is a 32 byte long SHA256 hash
// of stable-marshalled container message.

  // `Attribute` is a user-defined Key-Value metadata pair attached to the
  // container. Container attributes are immutable. They are set at the moment of
  // container creation and can never be added or updated.
  //
  // Key name must be a container-unique valid UTF-8 string. Value can't be
  // empty. Containers with duplicated attribute names or attributes with empty
  // values will be considered invalid. Zero byte is also forbidden in UTF-8
  // strings.
  //
  // There are some "well-known" attributes affecting system behaviour:
  //
  // * __NEOFS__SUBNET \
  //   DEPRECATED. Was used for a string ID of a container's storage subnet.
  //   Currently doesn't affect anything.
  // * __NEOFS__NAME \
  //   String of a human-friendly container name registered as a domain in
  //   NNS contract.
  // * __NEOFS__ZONE \
  //   String of a zone for `__NEOFS__NAME`. Used as a TLD of a domain name in NNS
  //   contract. If no zone is specified, use default zone: `container`.
  // * __NEOFS__DISABLE_HOMOMORPHIC_HASHING \
  //   Disables homomorphic hashing for the container if the value equals "true" string.
  //   Any other values are interpreted as missing attribute. Container could be
  //   accepted in a NeoFS network only if the global network hashing configuration
  //   value corresponds with that attribute's value. After container inclusion, network
  //   setting is ignored.
  // * __NEOFS__METAINFO_CONSISTENCY \
  //   Policy rule that defines the condition under which an object is considered
  //   processed. Acceptable values and meanings:
  //     1. "strict": SN processes objects' meta information, it is validated,
  //       indexed and signed accordingly by a required minimal number of nodes
  //       that are included in the container, a corresponding object inclusion
  //       notification can be caught
  //     2. "optimistic": the same as "strict" but a successful PUT operation
  //       does not mean objects' meta information has been multi signed and
  //       indexed correctly, however, SNs will try to do it asynchronously;
  //       in general PUT operations are expected to be faster than in the
  //       "strict" case
  //     3. <other cases>: SN does not process objects' meta
  //       information, it is not indexed and object presence/number of copies
  //       is not proven after a successful object PUT operation; the behavior
  //       is the same as it was before this attribute introduction
  // * __NEOFS__LOCK_UNTIL \
  //   Timestamp until which the container cannot be deleted in Unix Timestamp format
  //
  // And some well-known attributes used by applications only:
  //
  // * Name \
  //   Human-friendly name
  // * Timestamp \
  //   User-defined local time of container creation in Unix Timestamp format
  // * CORS \
  //   It is used to configure your container to allow cross-origin requests (CORS). The rules are represented as a JSON
  //   array of objects with the following fields:
  //     1. "AllowedMethods": In this element, you specify allowed HTTP methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD.
  //     2. "AllowedOrigins": In this element, you specify the origins that you want to allow cross-domain requests from,
  //     for example, http://www.example.com. The origin string can contain only one "*" wildcard character,
  //     such as http://*.example.com. You can optionally specify "*" as the origin to enable all the origins to send
  //     cross-origin requests. You can also specify https to enable only secure origins.
  //     3. "AllowedHeaders": The element specifies which headers are allowed in a preflight request through the
  //     "Access-Control-Request-Headers" request header. Each AllowedHeaders string in your configuration can contain
  //     at most one "*" wildcard character. For example, x-app-*.
  //     4. "ExposeHeaders": Each ExposeHeader element identifies a header in the response that you want customers
  //     to be able to access from their applications (for example, from a JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object).
  //     5. "MaxAgeSeconds": The element specifies the time in seconds that your browser can cache the response for a
  //     preflight request as identified by the resource, the HTTP method, and the origin.
  //     
  //     The CORS schema is based on Amazon S3 CORS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/cors.html)
  //     configuration.
