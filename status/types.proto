// Declares the general format of the status returns of the NeoFS RPC protocol.
// Status is present in all response messages. Each RPC of NeoFS protocol
// describes the possible outcomes and details of the operation.
//
// Each status is assigned a one-to-one numeric code. Any unique result of an
// operation in NeoFS is unambiguously associated with the code value.
//
// Numerical set of codes is split into 1024-element sections. An enumeration
// is defined for each section. Values can be referred to in the following ways:
//
// * numerical value ranging from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (global code);
//
// * values from enumeration (local code). The formula for the ratio of the
//   local code (`L`) of a defined section (`S`) to the global one (`G`):
//   `G = 1024 * S + L`.
//
// All outcomes are divided into successful and failed, which corresponds
// to the success or failure of the operation. The definition of success
// follows the semantics of RPC and the description of its purpose.
// The server must not attach code that is the opposite of the outcome type.
//
// See the set of return codes in the description for calls.
//
// Each status can carry a developer-facing error message. It should be a human
// readable text in English. The server should not transmit (and the client
// should not expect) useful information in the message. Field `details`
// should make the return more detailed.
